\section{Introduction}
There are easy problems \cite{BrainBrainBrain1902a}, hard ones \cite{LightKnight2007a} and problems whose solutions are even harder than the problem that prompted it \cite{Swift1729a}. You should avoid all hard problems \cite{LightKnight2007a,Swift1729a}.
\begin{equation}
e^{-x^2/2\pi}+1=y
\end{equation}
Here is another equation
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}dx=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}
\end{equation}
Here is another equation
\begin{equation}\label{set_inclusion_eq}
n^2+3n+1\in \Theta(n^2)
\end{equation}
As we saw in Eq.~\ref{set_inclusion_eq} we have a element in a set.
Here is a matrix
\begin{equation}
A=\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\2&4\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
Here is a piecewise function which we call $f(x)$, \textsl{in italics} as opposed to $in italics$.
\begin{equation}
f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}0&x<0\\1&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
